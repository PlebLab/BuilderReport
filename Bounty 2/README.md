# 🔄 Bounty 2: Get X Data

This bounty implements the first actual **data pipeline**, pulling user data (e.g., followers/following) from **X (Twitter)** into the analytics system.

## ✅ Deliverables
- Create a new **table** in the PostgreSQL database.
- Build a **Zapier pipeline** to fetch & update data from the X API.
- Deliver a **basic Looker Studio dashboard** to validate the data.

## ⏳ Scope
- No frontend implementation or dashboard design.
- Purely backend: data collection, storage, and validation.

## 🗓 Timeline
📅 Deadline: March 29, 2025  
💰 Reward: $50 USD

## 🔑 Requirements
- X API key (provided by Pleblab)
